# CSC-325-Week-10-Assignment-Shape-Adapter
Week 10 Assignment, contains shape adapter design pattern


Assignment Instructions:

The objective of the Adapter Design Pattern is to create an intermediary abstraction that makes two incompatible interfaces work together. The adapter lets you create a middle-layer class between your code to legacy class, 3rd-party class, or any other class which you can’t change.

The problem with the Adapter Design Pattern is that the complexity of the code increases because you need to create & maintain new interfaces and classes. If possible, it’s often simpler just to change the target class so that it matches the rest of your code.

Problem 2:

An old system for drawing shapes forces users to recover the type of each shape because they are incompatible and you need to provide the right arguments.

There is a new package “newpackage” with a driver class that needs developing adapters so that it works.
